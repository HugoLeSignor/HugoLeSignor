# 👋 Hi, I'm Hugo!

I'm a 24-year-old student from France, passionate about technology, music, and the world of web development.  
Currently, I'm focused on learning the fundamentals of **HTML** and **CSS**, and I've recently started learning **SCSS** — I love it! I'm excited to expand my knowledge with more programming languages and tools as I progress through my studies.

## 🎯 About Me

## 🛠️ What I'm Learning

- **HTML & CSS**: Building and styling web pages
- **SCSS (Sass)**: Writing cleaner, modular CSS with variables, nesting, mixins, and partials — makes styling so much more fun!
